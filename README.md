Currently I'm working as a Solution Architect helping customers adopt DevOps and automation. 

In my spare time I coach field hockey and run a website. You'll find most of my hockey content shared via my YouTube Channel.

Wanna chat or have me on your show? I'd love to!! Ping me on my Twitter. My DMs are open 😃
